## Overview

This repository is forked from DigitalOcean's sample joke API function project to serve as the codebase for my personal website, hosted on DigitalOcean's App Platform as a Serverless Function component. The original functionality and deployment instructions can be found in the [original repository](https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-functions-python-jokes).

### Prerequisites

* A DigitalOcean account is necessary for deploying this project. Create one [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new) if you don't have one already.
* The [DigitalOcean `doctl` CLI](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases) is required for command line operations.
